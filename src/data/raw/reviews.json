It shows you how to change how you think about something and choose a perspective that is <strong>useful</strong> to you. The key is the word useful. So often we say that we seek “truth.” It’s a noble pursuit! But shockingly few things meet a strict definition of true. Memories are inaccurate. The past is interpreted. Science itself is series of models that are continually superseded by better ones. Even a question like “what time is it?” has no “true” answer because <em>it depends on where you are</em>. If we only pursued what was strictly true, we’d have very little to build a life around. It’s better to pursue what is <strong>useful</strong>. Beliefs can be useful when they cause us to take the actions that we want to embody. We can intentionally adopt useful beliefs and <em>reframing</em> is how we do it. This book is fairly cerebral (thinking about thinking!) so it’s probably not for everyone but I found it very empowering.</p>\n"

A key point is that by allowing our children to be raised online, we have crowded out valuable experiences in the physical world that help young people grow, develop confidence, and learn to trust themselves. In short: we’ve been overprotective in the physical world and underprotective in the digital world. What’s the solution? Haidt proposes <a href=\"https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/pdfs/four-norms.pdf\">four new norms</a> for parents and schools to adopt. I love these—they are simple, inexpensive, concrete, and memorable. This year, my wife and I became parents of a teenage girl, so reading this book felt like the responsible thing to do. I’m glad we did, and I strongly recommend it to all parents of preteen kids (in part because changing norms is a collective action problem and we need your help). For a taste of the book’s content, check out <a href=\"https://www.afterbabel.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic\">Haidt’s popular blog post</a> on the topic (or <a href=\"https://www.afterbabel.com/archive\">his other related ones</a>).

In the story, George Orr finds himself with the ability to change reality based on what he dreams. Unable to control the power, he attempts to suppress it and eventually finds himself in the care of a sleep psychologist (Dr. Haber). With time and research, Dr. Haber learns how to control George’s dreams, but wielding the power to alter reality can have harmful consequences (as you can imagine). The story raises some interesting questions. Is utopia possible? Is one person’s utopia invariably another person’s dystopia, because of our differing values? As a society, what are we working towards (and will we like it when we get there)? I like how Dr. Haber is a complex antagonist. He clearly wants to do what is right and his actions can be justified nearly every step of the way. His accumulation of power is for the purpose of advancing knowledge and addressing the world’s problems, right? It’s only when you look at the big picture that it all feels off. I’m not sure how I feel about the book’s ending but there was a lot to enjoy along the way.</p>\n"

There was strong foreshadowing throughout the book, which gave me with this feeling of dread, like I was watching a train wreck in slow motion. Charlie’s progression gives you a lot of things to chew on. The world can be a cruel place, even when it’s nobody’s fault. We’re all handicapped in various ways and we often hurt each other without even realizing it. Intelligence is a double-edged sword; ignorance can be bliss. The storyline itself was a whirlwind of human social dynamics and perhaps even an allegory for the journey we all take through life. Wow.</p>\n\n"

Ryan explains that the book is about justice, or more accurately, the principle of justice as the Stoics saw it. This ended up expanding the topic to include virtues like integrity, incorruptibility, and empathy for others. The book pulled stories from the lives of many people involved in causes of justice including Florence Nightingale, Martin Luther King, Harry S. Truman, and Ghandi. I especially enjoyed learning about Ghandi (I should read a full biography about him). There’s a tension in the book between being principled and pragmatic, with some examples of standing on principle and others of making compromises to achieve the greater good. Ryan gives no clear direction for these situations, arguing that life is messy and it falls to us to do the best we can at making these kinds of choices (an answer I found less than satisfying). Overall the book had great parts (the afterword was stellar, as usual) but it suffered from a lack of focus. It felt possible that he only wrote it for the sake of writing a book on each of the four cardinal virtues. I’m glad I read it nonetheless.</p>\n\n"

This book, The Wisdom of Insecurity, explains the causes of “Insecurity” (which today, we might call anxiety), the role it plays in our lives, and how we can overcome it. The discussion is wide-ranging, addressing topics like human desire, self-awareness, faith vs skepticism, science vs religion, and finding meaning in life. A key theme is the Law of Reversed Effort, which is often described in analogies: When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink you float. Or another: when you hold your breath you lose your breath. This idea applies to anxiety in that it’s our efforts to obtain security that results in the insecurity we feel daily (this was also touched on in Pixar’s “Inside Out 2”). I enjoyed the topic and found resonance in many of his other ideas (especially his thinking around science and religion). For a taste of his thinking, see excerpts of his speeches <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpaUICxEhk\">in this whiteboard video</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYHp8LwBUzo\">this game trailer</a>.</p>\n"

The story is told from Klara’s perspective, which lets you see the world like a AI would see it. I loved this aspect of it. Her perspective is naive, often insightful, but also biased by her programming and early formative experiences. It colors everything that happens in the plot, which centers around this question of whether AI’s like Klara can fully replace humans. The book had a lot of symbolism, and I was able to discover layers of meaning as the story unfolded (especially in the parts about the sun). I found myself recommending the book to people before I even finished it. It was a joy to read.</p>\n"

The idea behind the book’s title is that most of us are so insulated from the processes that source these materials, that it’s like a parallel world—a world that’s both invisible and critical to our way of life. The book goes into great detail providing a history of each material, including its discovery, mining, processing, and scaling up to today. It’s a long book, but the author does a great job keeping it interesting by bringing a sense of curiosity and wonder to each chapter. The subject reminded me of playing the video game Factorio, where you spend a lot of time in the “material world” building supply chains for mining and processing materials. It feels like a topic we should all know more about, given how much our modern lives depend on it.</p>\n"

The sheer diversity of the addictions helped broaden my understanding of what addiction is. We really have to watch ourselves for signs of compulsive use of <em>anything</em> as a coping strategy, lest it become destructive. I liked her break-down of the efficacy of Alcoholics Anonymous, as it brought up interesting parallels with religious groups that have similar practices around abstinence. I also liked her perspective on self-binding, pro-social shame, and radical honesty—again, all practices that are woven into many religious traditions.

      "content_html": "<p>Author: Kim Stanley Robinson</p><p>Rating: 3/5</p><p>Red Mars is the first book in a three-book sci-fi series about humans from Earth colonizing Mars. It starts with the “first hundred” as they make their journey, arrive, and start building infrastructure. As they progress, various conflicts arise, from interpersonal drama to philosophical debates (whether or not to terraform, how they will be governed, etc). The book was reasonably technical and not too speculative (though it’s probably 100+ years ahead of where we are today). My biggest complaint was the number of main characters and storylines, which made the book feel a bit tedious (it was 640 pages). I’d still recommend it, if you’re the kind of person who likes thinking about Mars colonization.</p>\n"

The book is just as much art as it is literature, each page being illustrated with a distinctive combination of watercolor and scribbley ink. The illustrations look nice but they also show what’s happening on the journey, giving context to the messages. The custom drawn words were a bit difficult to read but it had the effect of slowing me down, making the messages more impactful. Still, it was a quick read and good for all ages. The whole vibe was like “The Little Prince” meets “Frog and Toad are Friends”—both classics in their own right. The sheet music on the inside cover was a nice touch too (I played it on the piano and it sounded great). Highly recommended!</p>\n"

The author had this ability to take a latent feeling (like frustration with technology) and put it into words, making me say “Yes! That’s what it is!” I experienced this in his discussion of “gumption traps” (basically, managing your motivation), and also the “lack of care” that we see in the world.

To answer that question, this book explores the ideas of the late literary philosopher René Girard, who taught that much of our desire is mimetic. To explain, our wanting often comes from models—people we use as a reference for ourselves. These could be role models (who we want to be like) or rivals (who we don’t want to be like). We can easily get swept away in mimetic cycles (like competition or mob behavior), where our desires spiral out of control. This isn’t ideal, since it often leads to violence or other regrettable outcomes. The book offers some ideas on how to identify our true (“thick”) desires and pursue them intentionally, for a more satisfying life. Overall, the topic was interesting and approachable. A good tool for increasing your self-awareness.</p>\n"

The book’s narrative is built around a challenge that the author (Michael Easter) undertook to survive in the arctic for 30+ days. Throughout the story, Easter describes the impact of our modern environment on our minds and our bodies, including lots of good research and expert opinion. He gave words to some concepts I had believed but not articulated, like “comfort creep,” where we adapt to yesterday’s comforts until they become unacceptable (similar to lifestyle creep), and “problem creep,” where we regularly lower our threshold for what constitutes a problem. This is how we become, as George Bernard Shaw says, <em>“a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that life will not devote itself to making you happy.”</em> The book covers many lifestyle topics, like physical activity, eating, boredom, sleep, and our modern exposure to nature, hunger, noise, and death. Some of Easter’s solutions included undertaking deliberate challenges (Misogis), gratitude, and designing more workflows into our lives that our bodies are better adapted for (more exposure to nature, more quiet, more boredom, more hunger, and more daily, functional, physical activity). There’s lots of overlap with Stoicism. It feels like a book that everyone should read!</p>\n"

The book was not what I expected though. It jumps right into defining finite games and infinite games but without any real context or examples. There was no narrative or prose at all—it was like reading “board game instructions” meets “the book of Proverbs.” The discussion of games shifted in many directions like, art, history, culture, nature, and religion, but everything was discussed in philosophical and abstract terms. It was frankly difficult to follow, and hard to find application to anything real. I guess I was hoping the book would help me identify finite or infinite games in my life so I could decide whether I wanted to play them (or how I wanted to play them). The book was too abstract for that. Regardless, it seems like it contains some interesting ideas if you’re willing to put in the time and effort to unpack them.</p>\n"

The book is about improving your life by setting boundaries in your relationships, (all of your relationships, including you/spouse, you/child, you/parent, and you/friend). It was written by a psychologist but the text is so heavily Christian-influenced that it almost felt like a sermon (especially how it used scripture references to support its assertions). I was skeptical about the Christian framing at first but it ended up adding value to the book, because the fact is that people often use Christian principles (like meekness, humility, charity, obedience, “turning the other cheek,” etc.) to justify boundary problems. The book helps you navigate those issues and clearly see where your personal boundaries actually lie. It turned out to be surprisingly tangible: you control what you do and others control what they do. I especially appreciated all of the example conflicts, which made the principles a lot more clear. Overall, the book was a lot less boring and more helpful than I expected it to be.</p>\n"

You would think this abundance would result in peace and prosperity but instead we find a society of illiteracy, crime, and tribalism. It’s a fascinating juxtaposition and one I was excited to explore. While I enjoyed much of the story, I struggled to keep track of all the politics, which ended up being pretty central to the story. There were a lot of tribes, locations, and people, and the book wasn’t very explicit on their roles, which left me wondering who was rebelling against who (and why). I suspect everything would be easier to follow on a second read-through. Regardless, the book was still interesting. I always like stories about technology and its impact on society.</p>\n"

It argues that by saving too much, we postpone living our lives until it’s too late. The solution: aim to spend all your money before you die. I wanted to read it to challenge my worldview and it made some interesting points. Many people err on the side of retiring too late, exchanging valuable time for tiny risk reductions. Some things can’t be postponed, like experiences with older family members or activities that require you to be healthy. I was also intrigued by the idea that “you retire on your memories,” meaning, you’ll have a lot of time to think later in life, and good memories will keep you company. But instead of arguing for balance, the author tends to double-down on extreme positions and it weakens the book as a result. At times I caught myself laughing at how ludicrous some of his arguments were. In one case, he gets pedantic to make a point. In another, he tells a happily working friend that he needs to TRY HARDER to spend money (if you don’t want to, then do it until you do!). Ultimately, it felt like a devils advocate book: useful for questioning the dominant narrative but following it religiously could screw up your life. The core issue for me is that it all depends on a belief that satisfaction comes from consumption, which I simply don’t believe.

      "content_html": "<p>Author: Cixin Liu</p><p>Rating: 4/5</p><p>The Dark Forest is the science fiction sequel to Cixin Liu’s award-winning “The Three Body Problem.” The storyline picks up where the last one left off, with the people of Earth desperately trying to prepare for the invasion of a hostile alien fleet. This preparation includes the “Wallfacer Project,” a species-wide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass\">Hail Mary</a> that gives a few remarkable people access to a massive amount of resources to plan a strategic response known only to them (thus keeping it safe from enemy surveillance). These plans, and how they shake out, constitutes the story. It was clever, gripping, and there were some great twists along the way (despite the pervasive sense of hopelessness throughout). The whole concept of “the Dark Forest” felt like a genuinely novel answer to the Fermi paradox and I think it’ll stick in my mind for a while. While you’d likely need to read the first book to not feel lost, I felt like the sequel was more focused and overall better all-around.</p>\n"

He’s generally aimless and he has organized much of his life around avoiding “the Malaise,” an depressive funk that lies ready to ruin his mood. By the time the book was three-quarters done, I realized that the whole book was going to be like this… trivial conversations with his aunt about how he doesn’t like fishing while he thinks about how similar he is to his father. Maybe this is one of those books where the sole aim is to transport you into a certain time and place, or maybe I’m too dense to understand the symbolism. Maybe I <em>am</em> Jack and I’m reading the book to escape my own Malaise and it’s not working. Either way, I’m giving it 2 out of 5 stars.</p>\n"

Some interesting concepts emerged like the trade-off between present individual rights and future prosperity. I also liked the discussion around “Crusonia Plants” and Derek Parfit’s “Repugnant Conclusion.” That being said, most of the book felt like an attempt to persuade a certain type of person… like a philosopher who was morally opposed to economic growth.

Its good material, but to get the full effect you have to do the audiobook. Will Smith himself is the narrator and he’s in full entertainment mode, laughing, yelling, building anticipation, and putting on a performance. He often pulls in music and audio samples, which creates some great moments along the way. My main criticism is that the book felt a bit premature (like <a href=\"https://www.bryanbraun.com/books/#elon-musk-tesla-spacex-and-the-quest-for-a-fantastic-future\">the Elon Musk biography</a>).

      "content_html": "<p>Author: Sönke Ahrens</p><p>Rating: 2/5</p><p>This book is all about a note-taking process that claims to help you be a more productive and effective writer and researcher. The process uses a zettelkasten or “slip-box” as a tool for capturing ideas and linking them to each other. This produces a network of clustered ideas that allows research topics to emerge organically, as opposed to a more traditional system that requires you to predefine hierarchical topics and categories that risk becoming irrelevant over time. I liked the concept but I realized part-way through the book that this approach would have limited value to me personally since I don’t do much research-to-publish work. Ultimately, that drained my motivation and made it difficult to finish the book (thus, the 2/5 rating). That being said, the note-taking system was compelling and I’d highly recommend this book to anyone whose life revolves around research and publishing research. I may even adopt it to organize topics for my technical blog in the future (especially since there are several good zettelkasten-based note-taking apps out there, like <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a> and <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a>).</p>\n"

It’s a wild idea, but Yglesias makes the case that such a focused and ambitious national goal would push the country to work out solutions to longstanding problems, like reforming immigration, better supporting families, and improving transportation and housing.

It’s pretty disorienting (the first time the story switched, I thought my audiobook file was corrupted) but I started to get used to it. The book ended without tying things together clearly which made me think it was the kind of book that needed multiple readings to fully appreciate.

One chapter says “Pursue Learning.” Another says “Pursue Wealth.” One says to chase the future while another says to live in the present. The chapters blatantly contradict each other, and while your instinct is to ask, “so which one’s right?” the book’s ending gives you a better way to look at it (I won’t give it away!).

Christensen</p><p>Rating: 4/5</p><p>In this book, Clayton Christensen (and his co-authors) take the business management principles that he’s developed over his career as a professor at Harvard Business School, and uses them as a lens for making life decisions. Early in the book, Clayton describes how several people in his HBS graduating class had achieved great salaries and titles over the years, but suffered from a series of failed relationships, or even ended up in prison. As a result, Clayton’s advice centers around helping people find meaningful work, build strong family relationships, and live with integrity. It was one of those books where as I was listening to it, I thought “I should be taking notes!” I was particularly impacted by the parts about investing in your children by creating a strong family culture. Overall, a very important book (especially for working parents), and one I hope to revisit in the future.</p>\n"

Not “become famous” or “achieve a comfortable lifestyle.” I was pretty skeptical because this felt like huckster territory, but as the book progressed, I found myself nodding my head to a lot of the concepts. For example: “your wealth should always be used to generate more wealth,” and “don’t scale your standard of living with income.” I ended up feeling pretty confident that if someone followed all his advice, then yeah, they’d probably end up rich (but of course, it’s not always easy advice to follow).

While reading, several things stuck out to me. Between the poverty of his childhood, the health challenges that afflicted his family, and the persecutions of his critics, Joseph’s short life was a struggle. Yet despite it all, he remained singularly focused on building a society of people who sought a closer connection to God (it turns out that 1840’s frontier America was an exceptionally difficult time and place to do it). Joseph’s remarkable claims were polarizing and his personal flaws left many disillusioned. But his singular vision drew thousands to his cause, and created a legacy that continues beyond his death and into modern times.</p>\n"

Bell Labs played a huge role in the advancement of information technology in the 1900s. The labs started at a time when invention was largely trial and error (think, “Edison’s 1000 attempts to build a light bulb”). By hiring scientists to do fundamental research, they made a ton of discoveries and then applied them towards their business of building out a world-wide communications network. The labs produced 9 Nobel Prizes, and dozens of inventions (like the transistor, laser, fiber-optics, cell towers, and Unix), before\nthe break-up of the Western Electric monopoly led to the labs decline.

The author creates an entire world out of double-meanings, personifications, and literary devices, which is equal parts awe-inspiring and laugh-out-loud funny. Every scene twists your perspective, from the boy who grows downward (from his final, eventual, height), to the island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping). It’s as if Alice fell down the rabbit hole, only to land in a Shel Silverstien world.

But there was a time when those ideas were fairly heretical. This book, originally published in 1973 (before Vanguard created the first Index Fund), was one of the first to make a comprehensive case for passive, diversified, long-term investing, in a world full of stock brokers and analysts attempting to beat the market. The author uses academic ideas like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis\">Random Walk Hypothesis</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis\">Efficient-Market Hypothesis</a> to support his case, and provides case-studies and counter-arguments for seemingly every alternative investing approach.

Once he did, however, he spent the rest of his life pursuing a mix of productive hobbies and public service (which, I admit, made me feel a bit jealous). The book meanders a bit in his later years, but many of these details helped paint a picture of his world (like negotiating with Quakers or arguing in favor of the smallpox vaccine).

For example, strong listening skills and non-superficial 1-on-1 interactions results in great networking. <a href=\"https://www.bryanbraun.com/books/#the-obstacle-is-the-way\">The Obstacle is the Way</a>!</p>\n"

Now, those who have read Seth’s blog and other books will recognize many of the ideas here. The real value here is that Seth has pulled all his marketing wisdom together into one cohesive work.

      "content_html": "<p>Author: Nassim Taleb</p><p>Rating: 3/5</p><p>In this book, Nassim Taleb coins a term, “Antifragile,” to describe things that benefit from volatility. During extreme events, fragile things break, and robust things survive, but antifragile things thrive. Examples of antifragility are abundant in nature, like the immune response and the survival of a species (read: evolution). In light of this fact, Taleb embraces natural solutions, like free markets, minimalist shoes, gut instinct, free weights, traditions, paleo-style diets, and old books (see: the Lindy effect). Likewise, he condemns naive interventionism in its many forms, like overmedication, GMOs, the federal reserve, academic research, corn-syrup, bank bailouts, centralized governments, trans fats, globalism, elective surgeries, and tooth brushing. It soon becomes clear that Taleb’s views of morality are connected to fragility, as he spares no time calling out specific industries and people (labeled “fragilistas”) who produce fragility or transfer it to others. Overall, I found several ideas compelling. One interesting property of antifragile systems is that their strength depends on fragility at lower layers. For example: when an extreme weather event eliminates 80% of a species, the weak individuals (fragile) are removed from the gene pool and the species (antifragile) comes back stronger. Another interesting idea: traditional religions are a product of cultural evolution, and thus their practices are woven with features that make our societies less fragile. While the book has good ideas, it’s also fairly long and unfocused, meandering through a variety of semi-related topics while relying heavily on terminology from Taleb’s other books.</p>\n"

It’s a short story about a group of farm animals who rise up against their human owners and take control of the farm. Despite the animals’ utopian aspirations of equality and common rule, some animals claim positions of influence and things start to go south. It’s a cautionary tale of the corrupting influence of power (with obvious applications to human society). In reading, I was struck by how gradually their society transformed… how each small step away from their utopian vision seemed fairly reasonable until suddenly you realize they’re sliding uncontrollably down the slippery slope. I was also forced to reflect on Boxer’s motto “I will work harder.” As someone who values work, it made me see the perils of working harder inside a system with broken incentives. It’s truly remarkable that Orwell could package all these lessons into a story so simple that a 8-year old could read it.</p>\n"

And this isn’t just pitching positivity. He digs up dozens of examples where historical figures used their obstacles to achieve goals they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to accomplish. This book impacted me greatly because I read it just as I was facing an obstacle of my own, and it helped me see the opportunities I was overlooking.

It was a difficult read but I was able to pull out a few gems I found useful. For example, he says that instead of spending our effort satisfying our desires, we should seek to eliminate them. Perhaps the thing I liked most was feeling like I took a time machine into the brain of a person who lived nearly 2000 years ago, and seeing that this person was thoughtful, intelligent, and concerned about many of the same topics people still struggle with today. You start to realize that people weren’t stupid back then. Many were brilliant. And yet, the Roman Empire still fell.

For example, “choosing your problems.” He explains that we often pursue goals (like wealth or relationships), to try and escape our problems. But escaping problems is impossible. Even if we reach our goals, we just exchange one set of problems for another. So instead of pursuing outcomes we expect will bring us happiness, we should identify the problems that we enjoy solving the most and design our lives around that.

The author’s big claim was that all advantages can be reduced to environmental factors, and that theories ascribing advantages to superior genes are false. To show this, he takes you on a tour of the world’s cultures exploring the effects of climate, continent shape, local geology, the presence of wild plants and animals, and many other factors, looking for common threads. From these foundations, he showed how small initial advantages (like agriculture, writing, and centralized governments) can compound to make some societies unstoppable. The book had this ability to ask—and then answer—all these great questions that I never knew I wanted answered, like, “Why was the exchange of nasty germs between the Americas and Europe so unequal?”, “Why should microbes evolve so as to kill us?”, and “Why were most big wild mammal species never domesticated?”. The parts on plant and animal domestication were particularly interesting. I loved learning about the mechanisms involved, and experiencing this paradigm shift of realizing that everything we currently eat has been transformed beyond recognition. The book’s biggest flaw was it’s length. It’s a tome, and it can be quite academic at times, going into exhaustive detail on tribes in New Guinea, with relatively few insights to show for it. That being said, it gives you this sense that there’s a unifying theory of history, which is totally worth the effort.</p>\n"

In business, a company that fails to please it’s customers dies. Conversely, a macroeconomist’s theories can’t be proven true or false, so their career becomes a game of persuasion and politics (which produces little external value). Then, in classic Taleb fashion, he uses these points as ammunition for an epic rant where he lambasts journalists, academics, researchers, politicians, economists, gender studies majors, and pretty much anybody else who doesn’t meet his standard for statistical rigor.

He’s very direct, which kept me engaged, but I’m sure it could be off-putting to some. I enjoyed thinking about his idea that chaos is the default and that it’s much less remarkable than order is. This was a paradigm-shift for me. He uses this idea as a foundation to explain why life can be so challenging and how difficult it is to get your life, family, and mental health in order.

Nothing is spared: religion, liberalism (which he considers a religion), capitalism, individualism, human rights, and more. For one example, he takes Humanism (this idea that Humans are fundamentally different than other animals) demonstrates how foundational it is to human society, dissects it’s assumptions, and then describes how technical advances over time will increasingly expose it as a convenient myth. In his vision, our evolutionary history will drive us to pursue immortality and happiness, but not only will we fall short of both goals, we will undermine our belief systems one by one until we are circumvented by the algorithms we’ve created to serve us, and end up a passing ripple in the cosmic data flow. Oof.</p>\n"

I liked how it explained regression to the mean. I could have done without the detailed descriptions of all the betting experiments demonstrating minor variations of biases like loss-aversion. While not the fault of this book, I’ve come to realize that I’m getting bored of reading about behavioral economics, and I should probably move on to other topics.</p>\n"

Lots of self-improvement books focus on shortcuts, cliches, and clever life-hacks, while others uncover the difficult truths of reality and challenge you to change your character. This book was in that second category. Because of its focus on principles, the “7 Habits” can improve all aspects of life, from career to parenting. The habits are: 1) Be Proactive, 2) Begin with the End in Mind, 3) Put First Things First, 4) Think Win/Win, 5) Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood, 6) Synergize, and 7) Sharpen the Saw. All were great topics, but I especially liked “seek first to understand”. In fact, while reading, I started noticing how the conflicts around me were all rooted in misunderstandings that would be resolved if the parties truly listened to each other.

That’s being well rested, eating well, exercising, planning your day, turning off your phone, silencing notifications, and getting hyped.

Gladwell’s big idea is that the strongest opponents are weak by definition, and “underdogs” have incredible advantages. David beat Goliath because of his size, not in spite of his size. In classic Gladwell fashion he explores the concept through a series of stories while resisting the urge to tie everything together into a single unified theory. It was a good read that came at the perfect time for me.</p>\n"

With that in mind, I really enjoyed it. It had a lot of good things to say about the attitudes that leaders adopt. And honestly, I simply enjoyed having a daily stream of positivity as part of my morning routine. I could feel it improving my attitude and it helped me realize how harmful it is to constantly expose myself to the negativity of the news cycle (and my twitter feed). Part of thinking big is managing your attitude, and one of my big takeaways is to be more deliberate about that.</p>\n"

Ostensibly, it’s a self-help book with a focus on how to use thinking to create your reality, similar to “Think and Grow Rich” or “As a Man Thinketh” (so far, so good). But unlike those books, this one was abstract, dense, and lacking narrative… kind of like reading Proverbs or the Tao Te Ching. It also had this air of metaphysics about it, using self-defined laws to reconcile elements of Christianity with empiricism (with mixed success).

The book shines as it shows in gut-wrenching detail what awful struggles Musk had to go through through to bring his companies to life. The biggest issue with this book is it was written too soon!

The section on regular expressions falls short, and the encyclopedic list of array methods belonged in a different book (or on MDN). His flow diagrams (comprising most of the diagrams the whole book) are only useful if you want to write some sort of parser or linter (like he did…).

I gotta tell you, I was so excited to read this book that perhaps I expected too much. Don’t get me wrong, the book was a good read and it hammered home some solid principles (like the importance of being an artist, spending emotional energy, and overcoming the lizard brain) but it was hard to distill those principles down into concrete steps. Seth even mentions how abstract it is and then punts the responsibility, saying that only you can figure out how to apply the principles in your situation. The result was a good book that missed a good opportunity.</p>\n"

Large, loosely organized networks of people are doing better work for free than armies of highly paid employees of structured businesses. With this in mind, Seth writes a series of insights and suggestions on how our education should be adapted to better prepare the youth of America for a very different job market than the one their grandparents went into.</p>\n"

Throughout the story, the 3D reader begins to effectively understand the perspective of a 2D shape. The experience of hopping through worlds of various dimensions actually teaches mathematic principles leading up to extrapolating out concepts of higher dimensional planes. It’s incredible that such concepts can be taught in such a short and simple book. Brilliant. By the way, the book is not a romance in the modern sense and it is in the public domain.

It’s an age-old story of how nothing is more powerful than a motivated person who is driven to keep their commitment, no matter what. If you want to be invaluable, read this book, and train yourself to be like that person. Period.</p>\n"
